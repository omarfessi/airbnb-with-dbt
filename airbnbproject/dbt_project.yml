# Configuring models
# Full documentation: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-models

# In this example config, we tell dbt to build all models in the example/
# directory as views. These settings can be overridden in the individual model
# files using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.

# You can also use the full resource path (including the project name, and subdirectories) to configure an individual snapshot from your dbt_project.yml file.

# For a project named airbnbproject, 
# with a snapshot file within the snapshots/ directory,
# where the snapshot is named raw_hosts_scd_2, 
# this would look like:
